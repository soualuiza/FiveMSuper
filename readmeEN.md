Script that enables commands that give superpowers to the player in FiveM (GTA V).

All the Client Side code is located in client.js. Within FiveM, press F8 and type the commands you wish to use (or use the T chat). Commands:

"superstrength" or "/superstrength" - Increases the multiplier for physical attacks by 9999x.
"normalstrength" or "/normalstrength" - Reverts the strength back to normal, changing the multiplier for physical attacks to 1x.
"powers" or "/powers" - Grants the ability to super jump and increases the player's speed by 5x.
